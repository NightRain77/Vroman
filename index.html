    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This volume, the Genealogy of the Vrooman Family, is the result of years of painstaking work by many historians, genealogists and interested members of the family. The search for Vrooman Families residing in both the United States and in Canada has been thorough. The records of the United States Census Bureau, church records, family Bibles, gravestone inscriptions, family letters, court house files of deeds and wills, vital statistics, tax rolls, etc., have been copied with much care.</p>
    <p>Prof. Jonathan Pearson of Union College several years ago, wrote an extensive treatise of the early settlers of the Mohawk Valley. He included in his study the Vrooman Family. He was accurate and painstaking in his findings. Mrs. Charlotte Taylor Luckhurst, several years deceased, of Albany spent thirty years in compiling facts about the family. On her 76th birthday she wrote as follows:</p>
    <div class="indented"><p>I collected materal for more than 20 years. On every item I found about the family, I gave authority on each sheet. I made a full copy of all Vroomans in everry church and Surrogate or land record in this part of the country, say nothing of Bibles and cemetery records as well as hundreds of letters and genealogical forms filled in. There was about what would have filled a steamer trunk when Mrs. Wickersham took it from me, my health and age showing that I would never be able to complete the work and keep up the work for my clients. </p></div>
    <p>Mrs. George Walker of Los Angeles has for years carried on an extensive correspondence with hundreds of Vroomans in various parts of the country. She has their names arranged in alphabetical order with a biographical sketch for each one. She has generously loaned us this material.</p>
    <p>In 1946, a genealogy entitled Josiah B. Vrooman, His Ancestors and Descendants was published by Lora Vrooman Randall and Florence Vrooman Houghton. The volume covers quite thoroughly the descendants of Josiah B. Vrooman, 1778-1850. He belonged to the sixth generation of the Vrooman Family. They have aided us with their work on this particular branch of the family. </p>
    <p>Henry Cady of Utica, N.Y. some years ago prepared a short genealogy of the Vrooman family, following quite closely Dutch Reform Church-records and those data left by Jonathan Pearson. We have made use of his manuscript. We have in our possession not only the material accumulated by those mentioned above but we have been collecting data on the family for about twenty years. </p>
    <p>The volume as it will appear is neither perfect nor complete. There are many lost families that we hope will be located soon. The book will contain some errors. We hope it will be possible for us to publish later ADDENDA ET ERRATA to the Vrooman genealogy. This will be possible only if members of the family write in giving us additional information and pointing out errors that occur. </p>
    <p>The spelling of the name Vrooman (Vroman) varies with the family. It seems to have been a matter of personal preference with some. Our inability to consult each individual as to his preference has caused us to appear rather arbitrury in many cases. We have used the "oo" unless otherwise instructed, as most of the early Church records and records of wills and deeds were spelled that way. </p>

    <h3>The Egmont Tradition</h3>
    <p>No family tradition is stronger than that existing among the Vroomans as to the origin of the family name. The Vroomans claim, and there is some factual basis for their belief, that we are descendants from the Egmont family, of which Count Egmont, Prince of Gavre, 1522-1568 was outstanding. So strong has this belief been that members of the family have given their children the Egmont name. <a href="#1918">Frank Buffington Vrooman</a> named his son, b. 1898, <a href="#3338">John Von Egmont Black Vrooman. <a href="#852">Jacob Vrooman</a>, b. 1808, named one of his sons, b. July 24, 1844, <a href="#1486">Henry Egmont Vrooman. <a href="#ElleryBryan">Ellery Bryan Vrooman</a>, b. Sept. 17, 1896, named his son b.1926, <a href="#HughEgmont">Hugh Egmont Vrooman</a>. <a href="#1921">Hiram Vrooman Jr</a> b March 1, 1871 named his son b Aug. 15, 1917, <a href="#3344">Egmont</a>. There have been some rather half-hearted efforts to actually reveal the connection that binds the Vrooman family with Egmont royalty. Years ago we were informed by a member of the family that one of our ancestors named Egmont was called the pious man or in Dutch, Der Frohmann, and that this was the orgin of the Vrooman name. The man telling us this did not know the name of the Egmont family using this appellation. We feel sure that even now most members of the Vrooman family do not know. Their letters so indicate. The Pious Man, called Der Fromme or Der Frohmann was Frederick III the elector Palatine. His sister Sabina had married Count Egmont. Thus Count Egmont married into the Frohmann Family. For verification of this see. p. 16 Vol. ix, 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica under the paragraph. Frederick III.</p>
    <p>Count Egmont and Sabina had eleven children, three boys and eight girls. After the execution of Egmont in 1568, Lamoral, Jr. fought in the battle of Ivry. The estate of the family was confiscated. The wife and children took refuge in a convent for a time, but historical record is rather vague as to marriages and offspring. Perhaps some real re:seach on this line would bring some tangible results.</p>

    <h3>The Immigration</h4>
    <p>In New York Colonial Manuscripts, Vol XIV, p 83-123, in the Manuscripts Room of the New York State Library, is an acccount book giving the debit and credit accounts of persons who came to New Netherlanbds from 1654 to 1664 inclusive, and who were indebted for their passage money to Dutch West India Company. The following entry is found on folio 87 of this account book.</p>
    <h4>Henry Bartholomeus debit</h4>
    <div class="indented"><p>voor vracht en kostgelt dat hy A 1664, 17 April p t'schip d'eendracht schipper Jan bergen is herwaerts gekomen...1.36.-voor syn kinderen van 15, 13, 11, 7,</p><p>en 5 jaaren...126.-</p><p>1.162-</p></div>
    <h4>Translation of the account Hendrick Bartholomeus Debit</h4>
    <div class="indented"><p>For passage and board in coming hither, anno 1664, April 17th, in the ship DeEendracht (Concord), Jan Bergen, Master 1. 36.-</p>
    <p>For his 5 children of 15, 13, 11, 7, and 5 years...126s</p>
    <p>Total...1 pound 162 shillings</p></div>
    <p>This Hendrick Bartholomeus was Hendrick Meese Vrooman, Meese (Meesen), being the possessive form of Mees, or Meus, a short form of Bartholomeus and indicating that Hendrick was a son of Mees, or Bartholomeus Vrooman. Mr. Van Laer, New York Archivist.</p>
    <p>William J. Hoffman in the April number of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, 1936, has given us the following account of Hendrick Meese Vrooman's family found in the church records of Leiden, Netherlands. The name of Hendrick Meese Vrooman's wife was not given, as the mother's name is not found in the baptismal entries.</p>
    <div class="indented"><p><a href="#2">Adam Vrooman</a>, born about 1649. On May 23, 1670, he made the statement that he was at the time about 21 years of age. This also checks with the age given in the passenger list.</p>
    <p>Eve, born about 1651;</p>
    <p><a href="3">Johannes</a>, bapt. Mare Kerk, Lieden, Feb 15, 1653. Sp. Pieter Meese Vrooman and Catharina Johannis.</p>
    <p>Kathlyntje; bapt Hooglandsche Kerk, Lieden, Aug. 5, 1657; sp Josyntje Rebouts, Maritje Bartholomeus Froman (Vroman), a sister of the three brothers who came to America,</p>
    <p><a href="4">Bartholomeus</a>, Bapt Pieterskerk, Lieden, June 4, 1659; sp Maritje Bartholomeus Vroman.</p>
    <p>Hendrickje, bapt Hooglandsche Kerk, Lieden, Mar 20, 1661; sp Margarita Kannemans, Geertruyd Mentius.</p>
    <p>Vro(o)man may be derived from VROOM(E)MAN meaning pious man, or VRODE MAN, a Wise man.</p></div>
    <p>Traceable for many generations in the possession of the family in America is an heirloom, a wooden board bearing all the earmarks of great age, on which is painted an ancient coat-of-arms- A small drawing of the arms represented thereon is shown opposite page 276 of Pearson's "Early Settlers of Schenectady" .... It is unknown if this board was brought from the fatherland or if it was executed in America." ... Hoffman in "An Armory of American Families of Dutch Descent."</p>
    <p>In the Historical Journal of the More family published at Seattle, Washington, August, 1910, is this record - no authority given: </p>
    <div class="indented">
    <p>"Hendrick Meese Vrooman (Froman, Vroman, etc) son of Bartholomeus Vrooman, was born about 1618. Married about 1648. Geertruy Johannis, and lived in Leyden. His wife died and in 1664 he came with his children to Albany".</p>
