<section class="Introduction">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This volume, the Genealogy of the Vrooman Family, is the result of years of painstaking work by many historians, genealogists and interested members of the family. The search for Vrooman Families residing in both the United States and in Canada has been thorough. The records of the United States Census Bureau, church records, family Bibles, gravestone inscriptions, family letters, court house files of deeds and wills, vital statistics, tax rolls, etc., have been copied with much care.</p>
    <p>Prof. Jonathan Pearson of Union College several years ago, wrote an extensive treatise of the early settlers of the Mohawk Valley. He included in his study the Vrooman Family. He was accurate and painstaking in his findings. Mrs. Charlotte Taylor Luckhurst, several years deceased, of Albany spent thirty years in compiling facts about the family. On her 76th birthday she wrote as follows:</p>
    <div class="indented"><p>I collected materal for more than 20 years. On every item I found about the family, I gave authority on each sheet. I made a full copy of all Vroomans in everry church and Surrogate or land record in this part of the country, say nothing of Bibles and cemetery records as well as hundreds of letters and genealogical forms filled in. There was about what would have filled a steamer trunk when Mrs. Wickersham took it from me, my health and age showing that I would never be able to complete the work and keep up the work for my clients. </p></div>
    <p>Mrs. George Walker of Los Angeles has for years carried on an extensive correspondence with hundreds of Vroomans in various parts of the country. She has their names arranged in alphabetical order with a biographical sketch for each one. She has generously loaned us this material.</p>
    <p>In 1946, a genealogy entitled Josiah B. Vrooman, His Ancestors and Descendants was published by Lora Vrooman Randall and Florence Vrooman Houghton. The volume covers quite thoroughly the descendants of Josiah B. Vrooman, 1778-1850. He belonged to the sixth generation of the Vrooman Family. They have aided us with their work on this particular branch of the family. </p>
    <p>Henry Cady of Utica, N.Y. some years ago prepared a short genealogy of the Vrooman family, following quite closely Dutch Reform Church-records and those data left by Jonathan Pearson. We have made use of his manuscript. We have in our possession not only the material accumulated by those mentioned above but we have been collecting data on the family for about twenty years. </p>
    <p>The volume as it will appear is neither perfect nor complete. There are many lost families that we hope will be located soon. The book will contain some errors. We hope it will be possible for us to publish later ADDENDA ET ERRATA to the Vrooman genealogy. This will be possible only if members of the family write in giving us additional information and pointing out errors that occur. </p>
    <p>The spelling of the name Vrooman (Vroman) varies with the family. It seems to have been a matter of personal preference with some. Our inability to consult each individual as to his preference has caused us to appear rather arbitrury in many cases. We have used the "oo" unless otherwise instructed, as most of the early Church records and records of wills and deeds were spelled that way. </p>

<section class="Egmont">
    <h3>The Egmont Tradition</h3>
    <p>No family tradition is stronger than that existing among the Vroomans as to the origin of the family name. The Vroomans claim, and there is some factual basis for their belief, that we are descendants from the Egmont family, of which Count Egmont, Prince of Gavre, 1522-1568 was outstanding. So strong has this belief been that members of the family have given their children the Egmont name. <a href="#1918">Frank Buffington Vrooman</a> named his son, b. 1898, <a href="#3338">John Von Egmont Black Vrooman. <a href="#852">Jacob Vrooman</a>, b. 1808, named one of his sons, b. July 24, 1844, <a href="#1486">Henry Egmont Vrooman. <a href="#ElleryBryan">Ellery Bryan Vrooman</a>, b. Sept. 17, 1896, named his son b.1926, <a href="#HughEgmont">Hugh Egmont Vrooman</a>. <a href="#1921">Hiram Vrooman Jr</a> b March 1, 1871 named his son b Aug. 15, 1917, <a href="#3344">Egmont</a>. There have been some rather half-hearted efforts to actually reveal the connection that binds the Vrooman family with Egmont royalty. Years ago we were informed by a member of the family that one of our ancestors named Egmont was called the pious man or in Dutch, Der Frohmann, and that this was the orgin of the Vrooman name. The man telling us this did not know the name of the Egmont family using this appellation. We feel sure that even now most members of the Vrooman family do not know. Their letters so indicate. The Pious Man, called Der Fromme or Der Frohmann was Frederick III the elector Palatine. His sister Sabina had married Count Egmont. Thus Count Egmont married into the Frohmann Family. For verification of this see. p. 16 Vol. ix, 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica under the paragraph. Frederick III.</p>
    <p>Count Egmont and Sabina had eleven children, three boys and eight girls. After the execution of Egmont in 1568, Lamoral, Jr. fought in the battle of Ivry. The estate of the family was confiscated. The wife and children took refuge in a convent for a time, but historical record is rather vague as to marriages and offspring. Perhaps some real re:seach on this line would bring some tangible results.</p>

    <h3>The Immigration</h4>
    <p>In New York Colonial Manuscripts, Vol XIV, p 83-123, in the Manuscripts Room of the New York State Library, is an acccount book giving the debit and credit accounts of persons who came to New Netherlanbds from 1654 to 1664 inclusive, and who were indebted for their passage money to Dutch West India Company. The following entry is found on folio 87 of this account book.</p>
    <h4>Henry Bartholomeus debit</h4>

    <p>William J. Hoffman in the April number of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, 1936, has given us the following account of Hendrick Meese Vrooman's family found in the church records of Leiden, Netherlands. The name of Hendrick Meese Vrooman's wife was not given, as the mother's name is not found in the baptismal entries.</p>
    <div class="indented"><p><a href="#2">Adam Vrooman</a>, born about 1649. On May 23, 1670, he made the statement that he was at the time about 21 years of age. This also checks with the age given in the passenger list.</p>

    <p>Traceable for many generations in the possession of the family in America is an heirloom, a wooden board bearing all the earmarks of great age, on which is painted an ancient coat-of-arms- A small drawing of the arms represented thereon is shown opposite page 276 of Pearson's "Early Settlers of Schenectady" .... It is unknown if this board was brought from the fatherland or if it was executed in America." ... Hoffman in "An Armory of American Families of Dutch Descent."</p>
    <p>In the Historical Journal of the More family published at Seattle, Washington, August, 1910, is this record - no authority given: </p>
    <div class="indented">
    <p>"Hendrick Meese Vrooman (Froman, Vroman, etc) son of Bartholomeus Vrooman, was born about 1618. Married about 1648. Geertruy Johannis, and lived in Leyden. His wife died and in 1664 he came with his children to Albany".</p>
    </div>
    <p>At the time of the arrival of Hendrick Meese Vrooman in New Netherlands in 1664 with his five children, there were already two other sons of Bartholomeus Vrooman of Holland residing in the New World, Pieter Meese Vrooman and Jacob Meese Vrooman. Peter Meese Vrooman is mentioned as one of the early inhabitants of Beverwijck (Albany) in 1655. He was a master carpenter, surveyor and a millwright. He was the owner of considerable property in Beverwijck (or Fort 01·ange) and a person of some importance. In 1669 he was appointed magistrate of the colony of Rensslaerwijck which office he held until 1671. He was married twice. By his first wife, name unknown, he had a son, Mattys Pietersz Vrooman, who married Maria Arnoutse Viele. In the will of Matthys Pietersz and his wife Marya Vrooman dated April 4, 1684, the only child spoken of was a daughter Geertrude. After the death of Matthys, Maria Arnoutse Viele Vrooman married Douwe Aukes, Feb. 4, 1685, by whom she had one child, Margaret. In the massacre of Schenectady, 1690 both children and their mother, Maria Viele Aukes, were killed.</p>
    <p>The second son of Bartholomeus Vrooman, Jacob Meese Vrooman, married Elizabeth Lendt or Vanderlinde, the widow of Tuenis Cornelise Swart, about 1685. Jacob was a carpenter and surveyor of Beverwijck (Albany). In his will he spoke of no children but his wife who was to occupy the house by the bridge "formerly Domine Schaets". He died in 1691, After his death his widow married Wouter Uythoff of Albany.</p>
    <p>The first two brothers, sons of Bartholomeus Vrooman residing in the new world, left no descendants, and the Vrooman family in consideration here descended from the third brother Hendrick Meese Vrooman. The five children accompanying Hendrick Meese Vrooman to the New World in 1664 were: </p>

<h4>Coat of Arms</h4>
<p>The seat of this family was in Holland</p>
<p>Arms:</p>
<div class="indented">
    <p>Per fesse, one, per pale, (a) or chevronny gules, (b) or fretty gules; two, barry of three, purpure; or fretty gules, gules, gules, over all a fesse purpure, charged with a heart inverted and surmounted by a crescent sable.</p>
</div>
<p>Crest:</p>
<div class="indented">
    <p>Issuant from a mount vert, charged with five bezents, two pine cones sable.</p>
</div>
<p>On June 9, 1897 Abraham Giles Brower of Utica, N.Y. wrote a letter to Hon. John W. Vrooman of Herkimer telling him about the Vrooman Coat of Arms that had been handed down to him.</p>
<p>The letter is as follows:</p>
<div class="indented">
    <p>The old arms that I have is painted on wood, being in distemper (not oil) which indicates that it was painted prior to the 13th century and is therefore not younger then 450 years. The quartering is the arms of Lameree branch of the Egmont family.</p>
    <p>We belong to the branch of Egmont Von Neijenburg which is the same family only the title of count did not descend in that line. We both started with Redbout, a Frisean King, in 725 A.D., and he was a thoroughbred. </p>
    <p>The crest indicates that the armour worn was made of rawhide and ornamented with plumes. For anterior to introductCon of iron for that use when your ancestors emerged from the swamps of Batavia to fight Caesar they were clad in armour of rawhide and their spears and clubs were more than a match to the Roman swords. At any rate the Romans never conquered them. The pomegranate indicates that the arms were in the Crusades and fought in the holy wars.</p>
</div>
<p>Several years later John W. Vrooman wrote the following on the bottom of the letter that Dr. Brower had sent to him.</p>
<div class="indented">
    <p>Dr. A. G.Brower died about ten years ago. He was an accomplished gentleman, a traveler, a historian, and given to research. He was proud of his Vrooman ancestry and visited Holland several times. This brief explanation is given to help you consider his letter and also Artist Crider's letter.</p>

    <h1>The Vrooman Family</h1>
    <p><div id="1" style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 20px;">1. Hendrick Meese Vrooman</div>Born in Holland, son of Bartholomeus Vrooman, came to New Netherlands in 1664 accompanied by his five children. After living "behind Kinderhook" and in Lansingburgh, he moved to Schenectady. About 1677, Pearson states that he purchased 20 morgens of land of the Van Curler Bourwery, a parcel of land commencing a little south of water street and extending south-westerly to or near the sand bluff, embracing the land covered by the canal and railroad tracts, being bounded, on the east by the land belonging to the Veeders. As there were then no public roads across the flats in this direction.</p>
    <p>Vrooman's land was reached by a lane still in existence (1883) called Vrooman's alley, or lane, extending from Water Street south-westerly', nearly parallel to Rotterdam Street. His village lot on the north side of State Street, extended from Lang Gang (Centre Street) to within 49 feet of Given's Hotel and extending back northerly about 500 feet.</p>
    <p>In historical documents preserved by the state of New York is a "List of ye people kilcl and destroyed by ye French of Canada and their Indians at Skinnechtady twenty miles to ye Westward of Albany, between Saturday and Sunday ye 9th clay of February, 1686 90" .... and among the names is that of Hend Meese Vrooman and his son <a href="#4">Bartholomeus</a>.</p>
    <div class="indented">
    <p>"Hend Meese Vrooman and Bartholomeus Vrooman kild and burnt, Item 2 negroes of Hend Meese ye same death." Hendrick Meese Vrooman's estate was inherited by his two sons, <a href="#2">Adam</a> and <a href="#3">Jan</a>.</p>
    <p>2. <a href="#2">Adam Vrooman</a>, b in Holland, Sept. 14, 1649, came to America in 1664 with his father Hendrick Meese Vrooman.</p>
    <p>3. <a href="#3">Jan Vrooman</a>, born in Holland, Feb 17 1653, second son of Hendrick Meese Vrooman.</p>
    <p>4. <a href="#4">Bartholomeus Vrooman</a>, born in Holland, June 4, 1659, the child aged five who accompanied his father to the New World in 1664.</p>
    </div>
    <p><div id="2" style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 20px;">2. Adam Vrooman</div> (<a href="#1">Hendrick Meese Vrooman</a>) b Sept. 14, 1649 in Holland and at the age of 15 came to new Netherland with his father Hendrick Meese Vrooman. In 1670, with the consent of his father, he bound himself for two years to Cornelis Vanden Bergh of Albany County to learn the Millwright's trade. For the first year he was to receive 80 guilders of silver and a pair of new shoes, and for the second year 120 guilders of silver.</a></p>
    <p>In 1683 he built a mill on the Sand-kil where the Brandywine now stands (1883). In 1688 he bought lnnds of the Mohawk Sachems at Fort Hunter. On June 5, 1688 he received from the Commun Council of Albany a grant of land consisting of about sixty acres which are described as "being on both sides of the Mohawk River west of Hendrick Cuyler's land - on the south side ten morgens opposite a place called by the Indians JUCKTANUNDA, that is STONE HOUSES, being a hollow rock on ye river side where ye Indians lie under when they travill to and from there country". The other pieces on the north side of the river, one a little "higher than ye said hollow rock or stone houses at a place called by ye natives SYEJODENAWADDE and so eastward down the river so as to comprehend twelve morgens and the other just above the marked tree of Hendrick Cuvler ... one morgen and three or four little islands". These lands were granted for a yearly rent of two bushels of winter wheat conditioned that he should build a small house on it and "plow a part of the land next spring".</p>
    <p>On the 22nd of April, 1703, he received a patent for his millwright on the Sand-kil, described us "all that creek near Schenectady and the mill thereon erected and all profit, etc, to the said creek belonging". He is said to have "enjoyed the same" about twenty years.</p>
    <p>On January 2, 1705-6, Vrooman bought additional land of the trustees of Schenectady for the purpose of erecting another mill there. All that remains to show the occupation of this spot for milling purposes by the Vroomans is the ancient brick house built probably by Adam's son <a href="#6">Wouter</a>, still standing (1883) and used as a dwelling.</p>
    <p>In 1707, he petitioned to have his patent confirmed and explained because some people insinuate that two small springs or sprouts of water which run into said creek and a1l meet at a pince called SYMONSE'S (Veeder's) meadow were not included in his patent; he therefore desired a new patent, which should include the same and the whole Sand-Kil to the Mohawk.</p>
    <p>Vrooman's patent for lands in Schoharie is dated Aug. 26, 1714. This tract comprised "GOO acres of lowland and upland", and was occupied by his son <a href="#7">Pieter</a> and his descendants. March 30, 1726, he obtained a new Indian title to the flats known as "Vrooman's Land", about 1400 acres of the best land in the Schoharie Valley.</p>
    <p>Adam Vrooman likewise with his brother <a href="#3">Jan Vrooman</a>, inherited about 20 morgens of land from his father <a href="#1">Hendrick</a>, who bought the same of the administrators of Mrs. Antonia Van Cuyler. Adam's portion consisting of ten morgens, lay directly south of the village and is now (1883) largely occupied by the canal and railroads. In 1726, Adam conveyed his portion to his son <a href="#10">Jan</a>. A wood lot was conveyed to him by the patentees of Schenectady on May 4, 1716, which extended along Union St. to the grounds now occupied by the New York Central railroad track and was bounded northerly by Green Street. This lot he gave to his son Jan, January 17, 1726-7, "being four morgens of bushland with one-half of the brewhouse thereon, erected and likewise one-half of the furnaces, coppers, vats, vessels, and all other utensils in said brewhouse, being at present in the use and occupation of said Adam Vrooman and <a href="#5">Barent</a> his son". This brewhouse stood on the easterly end of the aforesaid lot where the canal and railroad cross Union Street, which was often called Brewer's Street.</p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p>On the 4th day of May, 1718, the patentees conveyed to Adam Vrooman a "piece of pasture land butting the road (front street) south that lends from the north gate towards Jan Luykasse's forty rods and four feet, northward by the Mohawk River 29 rods. butting eastward the pasture ground of Johannes Teller 46 rods, and westward the land in possession of David Lewis 42 rods, all Rynland measure, containing 2 morgens 346 rods". In 1727 he conveyed all that portion of this pasture lot lying between the west line of No. 35 Front Street and the easterly line of said lot, 335 feet Amsterdam measure, to his son Jan, reserving however, a parcel 35 feet long and 18 feet broad for a burying place for himself, his heirs and assigns forever. This burying place now forms a part of lot No. 35. - Professor Jonathan Pearson, 1883 (History of Schenectady Patent)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Adam Vrooman was married three times. His first wife, Engeltie Blom, bp May 12, 1652, dau of Barent Janszen Blom and Styntie Pieters. His second wife was Grietje Ryckman, widow of Jacques Cornelise VanSlyck and dau of Harnen Janes Ryckman. They were married November 18, 1691. His third wife whom he married Jan. 13, 1697 was Grietje Margrietje Takelse Heemstraat.</p>
    <div class="indented">
        <p>Adam Vrooman's first wife, Engeltic Blom, was killed during the destruction of Schenectady in 1690. </p>
        <p>"Engel the wife of Adam Vrooman shot and burnt her child the brains dashed out against ye wall". To some of the inhabitants this assault (by the French and Indians in 1690) was not altogether unexpected and they had for some time previously taken the necessary precautions to prevent surprises. Among those who made a successful defense and kept the foe at bay was Adam Vrooman. Being well supplied with ammunition and trusting to the strength of his building, which was a sort of fort, he formed the desperate resolution to defend himself to the last extremity and if 1t should prove to be his fate to perish in the flames of his own domicil to sell his own life and that of his children as dearly as possible. His house was soon filled with smoke; his wife, nearly suffocated, cautiously yet imprudently, placed the door ajar. This an alert Indian perceived, and firing through the aperture killed her. In the mean time, one of the daughters escaped through the back door with his infant in her arms. They snatched the little innocent from her arms and dashed out its brains, and in the confusion of the scene, the girl escaped.</p>
        <p>Their triumph here, was, however of short duration. Mr. Vrooman succeeded in securely bolting the door and preventing the intrusion of the enemy. On witnessing Mr. Vrooman's courage the enemy promised if he would desist, to save his life and not set fire to his building. This promise they fulfilled but carried off two of his sons into captivity". Yates in Dunlap's New York, Vol 1, p 176-7. Narrative and notes copied from Long Island Historical Society Memoirs, Vol. 1, p. 312-316.</p>

They had fifteen children, nine sons and six daughters, most of whom attained maturity and left families. Jan Vrooman made his will Apr. 24, 1732. His village lot inherited from his father had a front on the north side of State Street, of 172 feet, extending from a point 48 ft, east of Given's hotel lot to the Stanford block. His house and lot and the westerly half of this lot, by his will, were devised to his son <a href="#32">Cornelis</a>, who died the next year, leaving the property to his mother by whom it was devised to her son Bartholomew in 1734. The easterly half Jan Vrooman devised to his son <a href="#28">Jacob</a>, who had already built a house on it. In 1686 he bought half of Jan Hendrickse VanBael's patent on the Normanskil. </p>
