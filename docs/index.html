<section class="Introduction">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This volume, the Genealogy of the Vrooman Family, is the result of years of painstaking work by many historians, genealogists and interested members of the family. The search for Vrooman Families residing in both the United States and in Canada has been thorough. The records of the United States Census Bureau, church records, family Bibles, gravestone inscriptions, family letters, court house files of deeds and wills, vital statistics, tax rolls, etc., have been copied with much care.</p>
    <p>Prof. Jonathan Pearson of Union College several years ago, wrote an extensive treatise of the early settlers of the Mohawk Valley. He included in his study the Vrooman Family. He was accurate and painstaking in his findings. Mrs. Charlotte Taylor Luckhurst, several years deceased, of Albany spent thirty years in compiling facts about the family. On her 76th birthday she wrote as follows:</p>
    <div class="indented"><p>I collected materal for more than 20 years. On every item I found about the family, I gave authority on each sheet. I made a full copy of all Vroomans in everry church and Surrogate or land record in this part of the country, say nothing of Bibles and cemetery records as well as hundreds of letters and genealogical forms filled in. There was about what would have filled a steamer trunk when Mrs. Wickersham took it from me, my health and age showing that I would never be able to complete the work and keep up the work for my clients. </p></div>
    <p>Mrs. George Walker of Los Angeles has for years carried on an extensive correspondence with hundreds of Vroomans in various parts of the country. She has their names arranged in alphabetical order with a biographical sketch for each one. She has generously loaned us this material.</p>
    <p>In 1946, a genealogy entitled Josiah B. Vrooman, His Ancestors and Descendants was published by Lora Vrooman Randall and Florence Vrooman Houghton. The volume covers quite thoroughly the descendants of Josiah B. Vrooman, 1778-1850. He belonged to the sixth generation of the Vrooman Family. They have aided us with their work on this particular branch of the family. </p>
    <p>Henry Cady of Utica, N.Y. some years ago prepared a short genealogy of the Vrooman family, following quite closely Dutch Reform Church-records and those data left by Jonathan Pearson. We have made use of his manuscript. We have in our possession not only the material accumulated by those mentioned above but we have been collecting data on the family for about twenty years. </p>
    <p>The volume as it will appear is neither perfect nor complete. There are many lost families that we hope will be located soon. The book will contain some errors. We hope it will be possible for us to publish later ADDENDA ET ERRATA to the Vrooman genealogy. This will be possible only if members of the family write in giving us additional information and pointing out errors that occur. </p>
    <p>The spelling of the name Vrooman (Vroman) varies with the family. It seems to have been a matter of personal preference with some. Our inability to consult each individual as to his preference has caused us to appear rather arbitrury in many cases. We have used the "oo" unless otherwise instructed, as most of the early Church records and records of wills and deeds were spelled that way. </p>

<section class="Egmont">
    <h3>The Egmont Tradition</h3>
    <p>No family tradition is stronger than that existing among the Vroomans as to the origin of the family name. The Vroomans claim, and there is some factual basis for their belief, that we are descendants from the Egmont family, of which Count Egmont, Prince of Gavre, 1522-1568 was outstanding. So strong has this belief been that members of the family have given their children the Egmont name. <a href="#1918">Frank Buffington Vrooman</a> named his son, b. 1898, <a href="#3338">John Von Egmont Black Vrooman. <a href="#852">Jacob Vrooman</a>, b. 1808, named one of his sons, b. July 24, 1844, <a href="#1486">Henry Egmont Vrooman. <a href="#ElleryBryan">Ellery Bryan Vrooman</a>, b. Sept. 17, 1896, named his son b.1926, <a href="#HughEgmont">Hugh Egmont Vrooman</a>. <a href="#1921">Hiram Vrooman Jr</a> b March 1, 1871 named his son b Aug. 15, 1917, <a href="#3344">Egmont</a>. There have been some rather half-hearted efforts to actually reveal the connection that binds the Vrooman family with Egmont royalty. Years ago we were informed by a member of the family that one of our ancestors named Egmont was called the pious man or in Dutch, Der Frohmann, and that this was the orgin of the Vrooman name. The man telling us this did not know the name of the Egmont family using this appellation. We feel sure that even now most members of the Vrooman family do not know. Their letters so indicate. The Pious Man, called Der Fromme or Der Frohmann was Frederick III the elector Palatine. His sister Sabina had married Count Egmont. Thus Count Egmont married into the Frohmann Family. For verification of this see. p. 16 Vol. ix, 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica under the paragraph. Frederick III.</p>
    <p>Count Egmont and Sabina had eleven children, three boys and eight girls. After the execution of Egmont in 1568, Lamoral, Jr. fought in the battle of Ivry. The estate of the family was confiscated. The wife and children took refuge in a convent for a time, but historical record is rather vague as to marriages and offspring. Perhaps some real re:seach on this line would bring some tangible results.</p>

    <h3>The Immigration</h4>
    <p>In New York Colonial Manuscripts, Vol XIV, p 83-123, in the Manuscripts Room of the New York State Library, is an acccount book giving the debit and credit accounts of persons who came to New Netherlanbds from 1654 to 1664 inclusive, and who were indebted for their passage money to Dutch West India Company. The following entry is found on folio 87 of this account book.</p>
    <h4>Henry Bartholomeus debit</h4>
    <div class="indented"><p>voor vracht en kostgelt dat hy A 1664, 17 April p t'schip d'eendracht schipper Jan bergen is herwaerts gekomen...1.36.-voor syn kinderen van 15, 13, 11, 7,</p><p>en 5 jaaren...126.-</p><p>1.162-</p></div>

    <p>This Hendrick Bartholomeus was <a href="#1">Hendrick Meese Vrooman</a>, Meese (Meesen), being the possessive form of Mees, or Meus, a short form of Bartholomeus and indicating that Hendrick was a son of Mees, or Bartholomeus Vrooman. Mr. Van Laer, New York Archivist.</p>
    <p>William J. Hoffman in the April number of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, 1936, has given us the following account of Hendrick Meese Vrooman's family found in the church records of Leiden, Netherlands. The name of Hendrick Meese Vrooman's wife was not given, as the mother's name is not found in the baptismal entries.</p>
    <div class="indented"><p><a href="#2">Adam Vrooman</a>, born about 1649. On May 23, 1670, he made the statement that he was at the time about 21 years of age. This also checks with the age given in the passenger list.</p>

    <p>Vro(o)man may be derived from VROOM(E)MAN meaning pious man, or VRODE MAN, a Wise man.</p></div>
    <p>Traceable for many generations in the possession of the family in America is an heirloom, a wooden board bearing all the earmarks of great age, on which is painted an ancient coat-of-arms- A small drawing of the arms represented thereon is shown opposite page 276 of Pearson's "Early Settlers of Schenectady" .... It is unknown if this board was brought from the fatherland or if it was executed in America." ... Hoffman in "An Armory of American Families of Dutch Descent."</p>
    <p>In the Historical Journal of the More family published at Seattle, Washington, August, 1910, is this record - no authority given: </p>
    <div class="indented">
    <p>"Hendrick Meese Vrooman (Froman, Vroman, etc) son of Bartholomeus Vrooman, was born about 1618. Married about 1648. Geertruy Johannis, and lived in Leyden. His wife died and in 1664 he came with his children to Albany".</p>
    </div>
    <p>At the time of the arrival of Hendrick Meese Vrooman in New Netherlands in 1664 with his five children, there were already two other sons of Bartholomeus Vrooman of Holland residing in the New World, Pieter Meese Vrooman and Jacob Meese Vrooman. Peter Meese Vrooman is mentioned as one of the early inhabitants of Beverwijck (Albany) in 1655. He was a master carpenter, surveyor and a millwright. He was the owner of considerable property in Beverwijck (or Fort 01·ange) and a person of some importance. In 1669 he was appointed magistrate of the colony of Rensslaerwijck which office he held until 1671. He was married twice. By his first wife, name unknown, he had a son, Mattys Pietersz Vrooman, who married Maria Arnoutse Viele. In the will of Matthys Pietersz and his wife Marya Vrooman dated April 4, 1684, the only child spoken of was a daughter Geertrude. After the death of Matthys, Maria Arnoutse Viele Vrooman married Douwe Aukes, Feb. 4, 1685, by whom she had one child, Margaret. In the massacre of Schenectady, 1690 both children and their mother, Maria Viele Aukes, were killed.</p>
    <p>The second son of Bartholomeus Vrooman, Jacob Meese Vrooman, married Elizabeth Lendt or Vanderlinde, the widow of Tuenis Cornelise Swart, about 1685. Jacob was a carpenter and surveyor of Beverwijck (Albany). In his will he spoke of no children but his wife who was to occupy the house by the bridge "formerly Domine Schaets". He died in 1691, After his death his widow married Wouter Uythoff of Albany.</p>
    <p>The first two brothers, sons of Bartholomeus Vrooman residing in the new world, left no descendants, and the Vrooman family in consideration here descended from the third brother Hendrick Meese Vrooman. The five children accompanying Hendrick Meese Vrooman to the New World in 1664 were: </p>
    <div class="indented">
    <p><a href="#2">Adam</a>, born Sept. 14, 1649 in Holland.</p>

    <p><a href="#4">Bartholomeus</a>, baptised at Pieterskerk, Leiden, Holland, June 4, 1659.</p>
    <p>Eva Hendrickse Vrooman born about 1651 in Holland who came to the New World with her father, Hendrick Meese Vrooman, in 1664, married Jochum Lambertse Van Volkenburgh and was a mmember of the Albany Dutch Church. She died at Kinderhook in 1706.</p>

<h4>Coat of Arms</h4>
<p>The seat of this family was in Holland</p>
<p>Arms:</p>
<div class="indented">
    <p>Per fesse, one, per pale, (a) or chevronny gules, (b) or fretty gules; two, barry of three, purpure; or fretty gules, gules, gules, over all a fesse purpure, charged with a heart inverted and surmounted by a crescent sable.</p>
</div>
<p>Crest:</p>
<div class="indented">
    <p>Issuant from a mount vert, charged with five bezents, two pine cones sable.</p>
</div>
<p>On June 9, 1897 Abraham Giles Brower of Utica, N.Y. wrote a letter to Hon. John W. Vrooman of Herkimer telling him about the Vrooman Coat of Arms that had been handed down to him.</p>
<p>The letter is as follows:</p>
<div class="indented">
    <p>The old arms that I have is painted on wood, being in distemper (not oil) which indicates that it was painted prior to the 13th century and is therefore not younger then 450 years. The quartering is the arms of Lameree branch of the Egmont family.</p>
    <p>We belong to the branch of Egmont Von Neijenburg which is the same family only the title of count did not descend in that line. We both started with Redbout, a Frisean King, in 725 A.D., and he was a thoroughbred. </p>
    <p>The crest indicates that the armour worn was made of rawhide and ornamented with plumes. For anterior to introductCon of iron for that use when your ancestors emerged from the swamps of Batavia to fight Caesar they were clad in armour of rawhide and their spears and clubs were more than a match to the Roman swords. At any rate the Romans never conquered them. The pomegranate indicates that the arms were in the Crusades and fought in the holy wars.</p>
</div>
<p>Several years later John W. Vrooman wrote the following on the bottom of the letter that Dr. Brower had sent to him.</p>
<div class="indented">
    <p>Dr. A. G.Brower died about ten years ago. He was an accomplished gentleman, a traveler, a historian, and given to research. He was proud of his Vrooman ancestry and visited Holland several times. This brief explanation is given to help you consider his letter and also Artist Crider's letter.</p>

    <h1>The Vrooman Family</h1>
    <p><div id="1" style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 20px;">1. Hendrick Meese Vrooman</div>Born in Holland, son of Bartholomeus Vrooman, came to New Netherlands in 1664 accompanied by his five children. After living "behind Kinderhook" and in Lansingburgh, he moved to Schenectady. About 1677, Pearson states that he purchased 20 morgens of land of the Van Curler Bourwery, a parcel of land commencing a little south of water street and extending south-westerly to or near the sand bluff, embracing the land covered by the canal and railroad tracts, being bounded, on the east by the land belonging to the Veeders. As there were then no public roads across the flats in this direction.</p>
    <p>Vrooman's land was reached by a lane still in existence (1883) called Vrooman's alley, or lane, extending from Water Street south-westerly', nearly parallel to Rotterdam Street. His village lot on the north side of State Street, extended from Lang Gang (Centre Street) to within 49 feet of Given's Hotel and extending back northerly about 500 feet.</p>
    <p>In historical documents preserved by the state of New York is a "List of ye people kilcl and destroyed by ye French of Canada and their Indians at Skinnechtady twenty miles to ye Westward of Albany, between Saturday and Sunday ye 9th clay of February, 1686 90" .... and among the names is that of Hend Meese Vrooman and his son <a href="#4">Bartholomeus</a>.</p>
